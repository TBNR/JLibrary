I thought it was rather interesting how these components work and their obvious versatility should be utilized outside of just Gearz alone.

Today, I open source these classes on behalf of the authors

* Twister915 (Joey S.)
* lbjdaking23 (Cameron W.)
* rigor789 (Igor R.)
* georgePadolsey (George P.)

This was initially developed for the Gearz project at the minecraft server mc.tbnr.net for popular YouTube celebrity TBNRfrags' Minecraft server.

These components can be used in free Bukkit plugins but must attribute TBNR, or the members herein in *all* distributions via the description block of the plugin.yml or via a NOTICE file in the plugin.
